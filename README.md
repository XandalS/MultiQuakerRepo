# MultiQuakerRepo
A repo for my multiplayer Quake map
The maps current title is the Colosseum of Tormius
It is a small map in the shape of a circle with 8 exits stationed around the map. In the center of the map will be elevated platform that has a rocket launcher on top. 4 of the 8 paths will lead to the elevated platform to help create a sense of risk to get to the center platform, there will be no cover for those on the pathways up or ontop of the platform.
For mor information, including a project manifesto and design process journal, see the [WikiPage](https://github.com/XandalS/MultiQuakerRepo/wiki).
